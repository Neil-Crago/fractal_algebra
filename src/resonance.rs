//! Defines the core concepts of Resonance for the Fractal Algebra library.
//!
//! "Resonance" is an abstraction used to measure and classify patterns of coherence,
//! harmony, or structural integrity within and between fractal objects. This module provides
//! the `Resonance` trait, implementations for various types, and tools for transforming
//! and filtering objects based on their resonant properties.
