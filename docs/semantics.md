# Semantics of Operations

## IFS (Iterated Function Systems)
- **Addition**: Concatenates transformation sets.
  - *Why*: Models union of attractors; preserves self-similarity.
- **Composition**: Applies one IFS after another.
  - *Why*: Models recursive layering of transformations.

## L-Systems
- **Addition**: Merges rule sets.
  - *Why*: Represents hybrid grammars; useful in generative design.
- **Composition**: Applies one rule set to the output of another.
  - *Why*: Models nested growth or evolution.

## FractalField
- **Addition**: Pointwise sum of complex amplitudes.
  - *Why*: Models superposition in modular space.
- **Negation**: Flips amplitude and phase.
  - *Why*: Represents inversion or destructive interference.
