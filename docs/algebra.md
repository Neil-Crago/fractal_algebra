# Algebraic Properties

## FractalField
- ✅ Commutative under addition
- ✅ Associative under addition
- ✅ Distributive over scalar multiplication
- ❌ No multiplication between fields (by design)

## IFS
- ❌ Not commutative (order of transformations matters)
- ✅ Associative under composition
- ⚠️ Addition is not strictly algebraic; it's a union operation

## L-Systems
- ⚠️ Rule merging is not guaranteed to be associative
- ✅ Composition is associative if rule application is deterministic
